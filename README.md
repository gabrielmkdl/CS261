This repo has all the assignments for my Data Structures class. The first assignment was to create a struct to represent a dynamic array and a linked list. The second assignment was to simulate a callcenter using stack and queue structs that I had to implement. The third assignment was to create a struct to represent a binary search tree. The fourth assignment was to create a struct to represent a priority queue and implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the least expensive path in the graph defined in 'airports.dat'. The fifth assignment implements a struct that represents a hash table.
